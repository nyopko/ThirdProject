But Uranus is unique in that it rotates on its side Uranus' unique sideways rotation makes for weird seasons.

Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 400 km/h (250 mph). NASA's Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.
