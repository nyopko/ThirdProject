                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Wind, temperature and precipitation are components of the weather that can be observed and measured for Kindergarten. The
                                            measurements collected and tools used can be nonstandard and must be age-appropriate. For example, the temperature may
                                            be above or below a given point (warmer or colder) or the amount of snow is marked on a dowel rod to check the depth.
                                            Weather measurements must be collected on a regular basis throughout the school year and then compared, explained and
                                            discussed each week and each month. At the end of the school year, a comparison can be made and seasons can be identified
                                            by the patterns that were measured throughout the year. Consistent review and questioning to deepen understanding are
                                            essential.
                                            Use technology to compare classroom data to local data, study weather events, communicate and share data with other
                                            classrooms, and record classroom data. </p>

                                    <li><p>Changes in the position of the sun in the sky can be measured and recorded at different times during the school day.
                                            Observations also can be made virtually. This data can be compared from month to month to monitor changes. Stars, groups of
                                            stars and different phases of the moon can be observed through books or virtually and documented throughout the month. The
                                            names of the stars, constellations or moon phases are not appropriate for Kindergarten; only the changes in appearances and
                                            what can actually be observed are included. The moon also can be observed in the daylight, at times. Drawings, photographs or
                                            other graphics can be used to document student observations.
                                            Demonstrating (either 3-D or virtual) and testing/experimenting (through kits or models) must be used to explain the changing
                                            positions (in the sky) of the sun, stars and moon. Review, question and discuss the demonstrations and observations to deepen
                                            understanding.</p>

                                <h6>Grade 5 Earth and Space Concepts</h6>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Eight major planets in the solar system orbit the sun. Some of the planets have a moon or moons that orbit them. Earth is a
                                            planet that has a moon that orbits it. The planets orbits are because of their gravitational attraction to the sun. Moons orbit around
                                            planets because of their gravitational attraction to the planets.
                                            Asteroids are metallic, rocky bodies that orbit the sun but are too small to be classified as a planet. A meteor appears when
                                            a particle or chunk of metallic or stony matter called a meteoroid enters Earthâ€™s atmosphere from outer space. Comets are a
                                            mixture of ices (both water and frozen gases) that are not part of a planet. Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>The sun is the closest star to the Earth. Scaled models (3-D or virtual) and graphics can be used to show the vast difference in
                                            size between the sun and the Earth. The sun is a medium-sized star and is the only star in our solar system. There are many
                                            other stars of different sizes in the universe. Stars appear in patterns called constellations, which can be used for navigation.
                                            Because they are so far away, they do not appear as large as the sun. General facts about the size and composition of the sun are introduced. Details (e.g., age of the sun, specific composition,
                                            temperature values) are above grade level. The emphasis should be on general characteristics of stars and beginning to understand the size and distance of the sun in relationship to the Earth and other planets. Current and new discoveries related to stars and the sun must be included.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>Models, interactive websites and investigations are required to illustrate the predictable patterns and cycles that lead to the understanding of day and night, seasons, years and the amount of direct sunlight Earth receives. Three-dimensional models
                                            should be used to demonstrate that the tilt of Earthâ€™s axis is related to the amount of direct sunlight received and seasonal temperature changes.
                                            Seasonal change should be expanded in grade 5 to include regions of the world that experience specific seasonal weather
                                            patterns and natural weather hazards (e.g., hurricane season, monsoon season, rainy season, dry season). This builds
                                            upon making observations of the seasons throughout the school year in the earlier grades and prepares students for
                                            understanding the difference between weather and climate.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>The different pieces of the hydrologic cycle (e.g., properties of water, changes of state, relationships of water to weather, effects of water on Earthâ€™s surface) from the elementary grades are formally combined in grade 7 and applied to the components of the
                                            hydrologic cycle. The movement of water through the spheres of Earth is known as the hydrologic cycle. As water changes state and energy
                                            is transferred, it cycles from one sphere into another (e.g., water transfers from the hydrosphere to the atmosphere when
                                            evaporation occurs). Ground water and surface water quality are important components of the hydrologic cycle. The porosity and
                                            permeability of the rock and/or soil (grade 6) can affect the rate at which the water flows. The pattern of the cycling illustrates the
                                            relationship between water, energy and weather.
                                            The movement of water in the cycle also can move contamination through each of the spheres. Relating water flow to
                                            geographic and topographic landforms and/or features leads to an understanding of where water flows and how it moves
                                            through the different spheres. Topographic and aerial maps (can be virtual) can be used to identify drainage patterns and
                                            watersheds that contribute to the cycling of water. Lab investigations or technology can be used to simulate different segments
                                            of the hydrologic cycle. </p>

                                    <li><p>The earlier concepts of weather and the physical properties of air and water and their changes are expanded in grade 7 to the
                                            relationship of atmospheric and oceanic currents and climate. Current and climate patterns on a global level should be studied
                                            using a variety of maps, models and technology (e.g., remote sensing, satellite images, LANDSAT).
                                            The causes of moving currents in the atmosphere and ocean must be connected to thermal energy, density, pressure,
                                            composition and topographic/geographic influences (e.g., continental mountains, ocean ridges). Studies also should include
                                            specific current patterns in both the atmosphere and the ocean that are mapped and documented through data. Contemporary
                                            studies regarding global climate must be based on facts and evidence.

                                    <li><p>The properties and composition of the layers of Earthâ€™s atmosphere are studied, as they are essential in understanding
                                            atmospheric current, climate and biogeochemical cycles, which are seventh-grade concepts.
                                            Understanding the interactions between Earthâ€™s spheres (Earth Systems Science) and how specific elements and/or molecules
                                            move between them should be emphasized. This study must include standard greenhouse gases (including water vapor), ozone
                                            (in the atmosphere and at Earthâ€™s surface), and natural events/human activities that can change the properties of the atmosphere.
                                            Contemporary issues and technological advances should be included within this concept. Real-time scientific data pertaining to
                                            air quality and properties of air must be incorporated into the study of atmospheric properties and air quality. </p>

                                    <li><p>The role of gravitational forces and tides are introduced in relationship to the position of the Earth, moon and sun. Models and
                                            simulations (can be 3-D or virtual) must be used to demonstrate the changing positions of the moon and Earth (as they orbit the
                                            sun) and lunar/solar eclipses, daily tides, neap and spring tides, and the phases of the moon. Earth and its solar system are part of
                                            the Milky Way galaxy, which are part of the universe.
                                            The emphasis should not be on naming the phases of the moon or tides, but in understanding why the phases of the moon or
                                            tides are cyclical and predictable. Advances in science knowledge regarding patterns and movement in the solar system are
